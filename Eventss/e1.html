    //In js mostly the code runs squentially only ,but events are an exception which executes only 
    //after certain event has occured
// For button in line 9 its not at all a recommended approach to add event listeners in html tag itself , it will give scalability or performance issues in long run
//the first approach is 

document.getElementById('but').onclick=function(){
    //code
}
//This approach may be preferred over the first one but this one dont provide us with vast number of features
//therefore the third method
document.getElementById('but').addEventListener('click',function(e){
    //code 

    //This method provides us with lots of functionalities and features 
    //this also takes in another arguement which is by default false , in some cases u may need to use it to set true.
//e is called event object and is important to know about .
/*It is kind of meta data for an event , it contains the time the event occured and other related informations like the type of event(click or hover)
*/

//time ,timestamped ,defaultPrevented(behaviour can be changed),target,toElement,sourceElement
//clientx, clienty ,screenx,screeny
//altkey,ctrlkey,keycode


/* EVENT PROPOGATION_____>
There are two context of event propogation 1]Event bubbling and 2] Event capturing , False (mostly) and True respectively.

Suppose u have a ul and on click it will display a msg , and there are li inside it and one of which when clicked display different message
, so all li come under ul so when clicked uls message will be displayed , but when clicked on specific li talked about , in false mode the message of li will 
be printed then the uls message and when set to true vice-versa happens

To stop bubbling i.e propogation from insidt to outside (false ) we use
 e.stopPropogation();



 e.preventDefault-> will prevent default behaviour of particular component or obj from happening.
